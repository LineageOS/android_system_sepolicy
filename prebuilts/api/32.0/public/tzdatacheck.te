# clear that only these domains should modify the actual time zone rules data.
# The tzdatacheck binary itself may be executed by shell for tests but it must
# not be able to modify the real rules.
# If other users / binaries could modify time zone rules on device this might
# have negative implications for users (who may get incorrect local times)
# or break assumptions made / invalidate data held by the components actually
# responsible for updating time zone rules.
